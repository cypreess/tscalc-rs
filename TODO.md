- WHen eval list fails, show position in the input where it failed.
- Handle functions like `round(<date>, day) + 1h`
- Handle timestmap as input, same as  of datetime
- When no input, return "now"
- Handle subtraction of the dates. Beware of botched syntax, exhaustive tests!
- Handle input after -- instead of stdin
